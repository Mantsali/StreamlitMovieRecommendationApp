The main aim of this project was to build a Movie Recommender System that used Machine Learning to accurately recommend movies to users based on their interests and similar interests of other users.

## Introduction

With the popularity of cloud-based streaming services maintaining user retention without subjecting users with content overload when observing content available on their respective platforms is important thus a need for a robust recommender system that will provide users with personalised suggestion based on movies they have previously liked and other users with similar interests.

## Expected Outcomes

- Analyse and identify key insight in the Movies dataset (Jupyter Notebook)
- Create a movie recommender system (Jupyter Notebook)
- Create a user-friendly Movie Recommendation app (Streamlit)
- Report findings (PowerPoint presentation)

## Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit (VScode), scikit-learn, nltk, surprise)
- Comet
- Github
- AWS EC2 and S3 bucket
